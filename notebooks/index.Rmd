# Introduction

(TODO)

## Conceptual differences between methods
There are three conceptually different approaches to deconvolution. 

First, one can try to achieve scores suitable for inter-sample comparison. In that case, one can ask "Do I have more T cells in sample A than in sample B", but one cannot ask "Do I have more B cells than T cells in sample A.".
This approach is used by GSEA-based methods like MCP counter. 

Second, one can try to build scores suitable for intra-sample comparison. In that case, one can ask "Do I have more B cells than T cells in sample A", however one cannot draw conclusions about the abundance of T cells in sample A versus B, given there could also be other, unknown cell types in the sample (e.g. cancer cells). This approach is used by the default version of CIBERSORT)

Last, ideally, one can build a score, that reflects the absolute quantity of a certain cell type in the sample. This approach allows both intra- and inter-sample comparisons.
