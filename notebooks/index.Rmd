# Introduction

This document is supplementary information for

> Sturm, G. and Aneichyk T. *Benchmarking methods for estimating immune cell abundance from bulk RNA-sequencing data*, *Manuscript in preparation*.

This document elaborates step-by-step how we derive our results, shows supplementary figures to support our study
and serves as an open-source pipeline to reproduce our results.

The source code and instructions how to run the benchmark are available from GitHub:
[grst/immune_deconvolution_benchmark](https://github.com/grst/immune_deconvolution_benchmark)
