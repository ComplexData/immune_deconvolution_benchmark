* quanTIseq and EPIC predict absolute fractions and perform in the mixing study at least as good as other methods. 
* Marker based methods (xCell, MCPCounter) as opposed to deconvolution-methods are superior when it comes to detecting minimal fractions (Sensitivity) and not predicting a small fraction when a cell type is not present (Specificity).
