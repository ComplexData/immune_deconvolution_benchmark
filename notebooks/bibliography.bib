abstract = {As interactions between the immune system and tumour cells are governed by a complex network of cellâ€“cell interactions, knowing the specific immune cell composition of a solid tumour may be essential to predict a patient's response to immunotherapy. Here, we analyse in depth how to derive the cellular composition of a solid tumour from bulk gene expression data by mathematical deconvolution, using indication-specific and cell type-specific reference gene expression profiles (RGEPs) from tumour-derived single-cell RNA sequencing data. We demonstrate that tumour-derived RGEPs are essential for the successful deconvolution and that RGEPs from peripheral blood are insufficient. We distinguish nine major cell types, as well as three T cell subtypes. Using the tumour-derived RGEPs, we can estimate the content of many tumours associated immune and stromal cell types, their therapeutically relevant ratios, as well as an improved gene expression profile of the malignant cells.-3 | www.nature.com/naturecommunications 1 1234567890 E nhancing a patient's immune response to cancer using immune checkpoint inhibitors is arguably the most exciting advance in the treatment of cancer in the past decade 1,2 . Unfortunately, only a subset of patients (typically {\~{}}20{\%}) show long-lasting responses post checkpoint blockade 3 . Combining prospective patient selection based on predictive response biomarkers (=precision medicine) and immunotherapy has the potential to further transform patient care. To date, it has been shown that location and abundance of immune cells are prognostic for predicting patient outcome on standard therapy 4,5 . In addition, for checkpoint inhibitors-like anti-PD1, anti-PDL1, and anti-CTLA4 agents, the presence of relevant T cell populations correlates with treatment efficacy 6 . Thus, it is likely that the key to predicting response to immunotherapy lies in the patient-specific immune cell composition at the site of the tumour lesion. In theory, it is possible to infer the immune, tumour, and stroma cell content of a solid tumour from its bulk gene expression profile if reference gene expression profiles (RGEPs) can be established for each tumour-associated cell type. Mathe-matically, this class of inverse problems is known as deconvolution 7 . To date, deconvolution of bulk gene expression has been described and validated for haematological malignancies 8,9 , where RGEPs can be established from peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs). This approach has been applied theoretically to solid tumours 10 , but until recently it has been impossible to validate this extrapolation experimentally. It has been difficult to obtain RGEPs for cell types that are not available in the peripheral blood, such as endothelial cells (ECs) and cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) and it remains unclear to which extent the gene expression profile of an immune cell changes upon tumour infiltration. With the advent of the single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) technology, however, it is now possible to determine gene expression profiles for tumour-infiltrating immune cells, tumour-associated non-malignant cells, and individual tumour cells from the same solid tumour biopsy. We collected and investigated RNA-seq gene expression profiles of more than 11,000 single cells from three distinct primary human tissue sources: To characterise cells associated with the tumour microenvironment we accessed data from 19 melanoma patients 11 , to characterise the baseline immune cell gene expression we accessed data from PBMCs originating from four healthy subjects 12 and last, we generated immune and tumour cell gene expression profiles from four ovarian cancer ascites samples in-house. In the following, we show that gene expression profiles from tumour-associated immune cells and from PBMCs differ substantially. Therefore, reference profiles obtained from PBMCs are insufficient to deconvolve the bulk profile of a melanoma tumour sample. We find that indication-specific immune cell RNA-seq profiles from different patients are sufficiently similar to each other to define a consensus profile for each cell type, and that these consensus profiles enable accurate deconvolution of bulk tumour profiles. Our results show that the generation of specific RGEPs is both necessary and sufficient to enable reliable estimation of tumour composition from bulk gene expression data. Our approach resolves tumour-associated cell types that cannot be estimated by RGEPs derived from PBMCs. We can identify nine different cell types including immune cells, CAFs, ECs, ovarian carcinoma cells and melanoma cells. In addition, RGEPs for immune cells can be used to estimate the unknown gene expression profiles of tumour cells from bulk gene expression data patient specifically. Our work emphasises the importance of generating RGEPs specific to each indication of interest. Results Gene expression of cells in the tumour microenvironment. First, to investigate the extent to which gene expression profiles change as immune cells move from peripheral blood to the tumour microenvironment, we compared immune cell scRNA-seq profiles across three human data-sets: (1) data-set of 4000 single cells derived from peripheral blood of four healthy subjects 12 ; (2) data-set of 4645 tumour-derived single cells from 19 melanoma patient samples 11 and an unpublished data-set of 3114 single cells from four ovarian cancer ascites samples. Single-cell RNA-seq data requires careful data processing and normalisation particularly when comparing data originating from different sources and sequencing technologies. To char-acterise the single cells and to illustrate genome wide similarities and differences in their gene expression profiles, we applied the dimensionality reduction technique t-distributed stochastic neighbour embedding (t-SNE) 13 . This is an unsupervised machine learning algorithm that places each single cell into a two-dimensional plane. Cells with gene expression profiles that are similar are placed close to each other and farther apart if they are more different. Figure 1a shows that clusters associated with specific cell types and from different data sources emerge spontaneously. The t-SNE map with data source-specific colour coding is shown in Supplementary Fig. 1 to visualise the cell-specific rather than data source-specific clustering. Using the aggregated single-cell data-set, we developed a classification approach that can identify cell types irrespective of the data source. We can identify and classify nine major cell types: T cells, B cells, macrophages/monocytes, natural killer (NK) cells, dendritic cells (DCs), CAFs, ECs, ovarian carcinoma cells, and melanoma cells. All remaining cells that fail to pass the classification threshold for any specific cell type are assigned as " unknown " . Interestingly, the " unknown " cells are mostly located in the T cell clusters, suggesting that some T cells are more dif-ficult to classify than cells from other cell types. However, the percentage of " unknown " cells per sample is generally very low ({\textless}0.03{\%}). Further, we could classify T cells into three subtypes: CD4+, CD8+, and regulatory T cells (Treg). The ratios of CD4+ or CD8+ T cells and immune suppressive Tregs were suggested as markers for immunologically active vs. inactive tumours 6 . Although our methods can easily be extended to include addi-tional cells and further subdivisions, we limited ourselves to the nine major cell types to benchmark our classification algorithm. As previously reported 11 and shown in Supplementary Fig. 2, malignant tumour cells and associated fibroblasts cluster by patient and non-malignant cells cluster by cell type. Tumour biopsies should contain immune cells from tumour blood vessels and from recently extravasated immune cells. Therefore, a partial overlap between PBMC and tumour-associated immune cells is expected. We analysed pair-wise similarities between the averaged gene expression profiles of each identified cluster. This analysis is more quantitative and robust to noise as the single cell comparisons. The results shown in Fig. 1b indicate that most clusters, while distinct, are most closely associated with clusters from the same cell types. This is an important quality control step that confirms that potential batch effects are successfully alle-viated by the data processing and normalisation strategy (see " Methods " section). Tregs seem to be most distinct across the three different data-sets potentially indicating different context-dependent subsets 14 . However, the microenvironment has a clear and quantifiable impact on gene expression. In the following, we will address the question if gene expression profiles based on PBMCs are good approximations for what is observed in the tumour microenvironment and how the PBMC-derived gene expression profiles impact the quality of deconvolution of bulk expression data.},

@article{TIMER2016,
abstract = {Background: Understanding the interactions between tumor and the host immune system is critical to finding prognostic biomarkers, reducing drug resistance, and developing new therapies. Novel computational methods are needed to estimate tumor-infiltrating immune cells and understand tumorâ€“immune interactions in cancers. Results: We analyze tumor-infiltrating immune cells in over 10,000 RNA-seq samples across 23 cancer types from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA). Our computationally inferred immune infiltrates associate much more strongly with patient clinical features, viral infection status, and cancer genetic alterations than other computational approaches. Analysis of cancer/testis antigen expression and CD8 T-cell abundance suggests that MAGEA3 is a potential immune target in melanoma, but not in non-small cell lung cancer, and implicates SPAG5 as an alternative cancer vaccine target in multiple cancers. We find that melanomas expressing high levels of CTLA4 separate into two distinct groups with respect to CD8 T-cell infiltration, which might influence clinical responses to anti-CTLA4 agents. We observe similar dichotomy of TIM3 expression with respect to CD8 T cells in kidney cancer and validate it experimentally. The abundance of immune infiltration, together with our downstream analyses and findings, are accessible through TIMER, a public resource at http://cistrome.org/TIMER. Conclusions: We develop a computational approach to study tumor-infiltrating immune cells and their interactions with cancer cells. Our resource of immune-infiltrate levels, clinical associations, as well as predicted therapeutic markers may inform effective cancer vaccine and checkpoint blockade therapies.},

@article{Li,
abstract = {We have recently published a statistical deconvolution method to study infiltrating immune cells using tumor RNA-seq data [1]. One of the goals in that work was to understand how proportions of different cell types co-vary across different cancer tissues. To this end, we esti-mated the abundance of six cell types over 9000 tumor samples across 23 cancer types, and then assessed the correlations of these estimated proportions across the different samples within a cancer type. In particular we compared our method (TIMER) with CIBERSORT [2], a previously published deconvolution approach, for their ability to assess such correlations. To our surprise, we found many non-biological negative correlations be-tween CIBERSORT estimates, and we believed that this artifact was, to a large extent, due to the incorporation of highly similar features in the linear model, or statis-tical collinearity. Newman et al., the authors of CIBER-SORT, have raised concerns that these correlations were due to data normalization, instead of collinearity [3]. While we agree with Newman and coauthors that the forced normalization indeed introduces unwanted nega-tive correlations, we will show in this response that the inclusion of highly similar features contributes as signifi-cantly as normalization, if not more, to the observed artificial negative correlations among the estimates obtained by CIBERSORT. Highly correlated features (covariates) in linear regres-sion models can lead to many technical difficulties, such as high estimation variances, non-robustness, and non-identifiability. Furthermore, it is often misleading to interpret their coefficients at their face value. For example, it is very easy to create examples where when only one of the two highly similar features is included in a regression model, its coefficient is highly significant and positive; whereas when both are included, none of the coefficients is significant or one is positively significant and the other is negative. This issue is a fundamental statistical problem due to lack of information and is unlikely to be solved simply by regularization employed by the CIBERSORT method. To evaluate how CIBERSORT estimations are affected by the incorporation of similar features, we conducted two in silico experiments. In the first one, we selected two unrelated cell types, CD8 T cells and neutrophils, from the CIBERSORT feature set, LM22 matrix. The Pearson correlation of the expression levels of the two cell types is 0.009. We generated 500 mixtures by randomly apportioning the population consisting of these two cell types only: Y = Y i , i = 1,2,{\ldots}500, where: Y i Â¼ f 1 ; i {\^{A}} X1 Ã¾ f 2 ; i {\^{A}} X2 Ã¾ $\epsilon$i},

@article{Newman,
abstract = {In a recently published article in Genome Biology, Li and colleagues introduced TIMER, a gene expression deconvolution approach for studying tumor-infiltrating leukocytes (TILs) in 23 cancer types profiled by The Cancer Genome Atlas. Methods to characterize TIL biology are increasingly important, and the authors offer several arguments in favor of their strategy. Several of these claims warrant further discussion and highlight the critical importance of data normalization in gene expression deconvolution applications. Computational approaches for enumerating cell subsets from bulk tissue expression profiles have significant potential for studying tumor cellular ecosystems, includ-ing tumor-infiltrating leukocytes (TILs) [1â€“3]. We there-fore read with interest the recent Genome Biology article by Li and colleagues in which they introduce TIMER, an in silico method for TIL deconvolution [4]. TIMER relies on prior knowledge of immune signature genes as input and consists of three major steps: (1) gene expression normalization across platforms and sample types; (2) selection of immune signature genes that are negatively correlated with tumor purity; and (3) deconvolution of RNA admixtures using a previously described technique for iterative linear least squares regression (LLSR) [5]. They apply TIMER to the inference of six distinct immune subsets (B cells, CD4 T cells, CD8 T cells, neutrophils, macrophages, and dendritic cells) in The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) bulk tumor expression profiles and investigate links between TIL heterogeneity, tumor genomic features, and survival in 23 cancer types. Several groups, including ours, have also proposed methods for gene expression deconvolution [1, 3, 5, 6]. We recently described CIBERSORT, an in silico tissue dis-section approach that is robust to noise, unknown mixture content, and closely related cell types (collinearity) [6].},
