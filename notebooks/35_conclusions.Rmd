# Conclusions

Not sure if the methodology is valid after all?


Anyway, conclusions:
* Some cell types (CTL) are easier to detect that others (DC)
* The deconvolution methodology is not the bottleneck, it's the availability of reliable signatures


precise definition can be controlversial (Jaitin 2014, Science, References 4-7)
is based on inderect association of function with cell surface markers (5-8).
